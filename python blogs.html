                <img src="img/python.png" alt="" width="100%">

                <p> Thinking of taking the plunge and getting your hands dirty with Python? Perhaps you’re already
                    familiar with the language, but want to dig deeper to find out just how far down this rabbit hole
                    goes?

                    Whether you’re a developer with some knowledge of programming or are just now dipping your toes in
                    these waters, you’ve made the right choice. Python is an easy-to-grasp language that is, at the same
                    time, versatile enough for you to do some interesting things with.

                    Still, the decision to learn how to use Python effectively is only the first step on this thrilling
                    journey. Once that’s out of the way, it’s time to educate yourself.</p><br>

                <p>It doesn’t matter whether you’re looking for basic tutorials or news on all the latest developments,
                    you’ll need some quality sources to keep you posted on all things Python.

                    To make things extra easy for you, we’ve compiled a list of 14 reliable Python blogs—it’s as good a
                    place to start as any!</p><br>



                <h2> Best Python blogs, resources, and websites to follow</h2>
                <h3> 1. Planet Python—the go-to Python blog</h3>
                <img src="img/python1.webp" alt="" width="100%">

                <p> Planet Python is probably one of the first sources you’ll ever consult for all your Python needs.
                    The reason for this is quite simple—it’s immensely comprehensive.

                    With several posts a day on average, Planet Python’s incredible range is owed to the fact that it
                    brings together recent Python-related posts from various other blogs. All the sources are reputable
                    and the posts themselves have been carefully selected as well, resulting in a blog that gets you a
                    good range of news and tutorials all across the board.</p><br>

                <h3> Notable post</h3>
                <p> With a blog as diverse as Planet Python, selecting one post that will serve as an example of the
                    site’s versatility is quite challenging, but if we were to choose a recent example, there’s
                    ListenData’s Pandas Python Tutorial. It’s a good indication of how in-depth the tutorials linked on
                    this blog can go.</p> <br>

                <h3>2. Full Stack Python—a comprehensive resource by multiple Python bloggers</h3>
                <img src="img/python2.webp" alt="" width="100%">

                <p> If you’re looking for a dedicated resource that will help you get your latest Python-based app up
                    and running in no time, Full Stack Python definitely lives up to its name.

                    It’s true that updates happen quite haphazardly—some months have multiple updates, followed by a
                    month of two or silence. Nevertheless, each new post is a detailed, very nicely presented tutorial
                    on one of the many platforms utilizing Python that will help you get your project off the ground.
                </p><br>

                <h3>Notable post</h3>
                <p> To best illustrate the full scope of their tutorials, the post about Flask is a great example. On
                    top of providing their own instructions and guidelines, Full Stack Python link to plenty of
                    resources geared towards both beginners and intermediate users, so you’ve got a lot of reading to
                    work with!</p><br>

                <h3> 3. Real Python—a comprehensive Python programming blog</h3>

                    infographics, videos, and an overall fun vibe, this course (because that’s what this blog is,
                    essentially) will show you the ropes and give you all the necessary tools to start your Python
                    adventure, while still whetting your appetite for more.</p><br>

                <h3>Notable post</h3>

                    standard package manager for Python.</p> <br>

                <h3> 4. PyBloggers—the best Python bloggers come together</h3>
                <img src="img/pyhton4.webp" alt="" width="100%">

                <p> Much like Planet Python, this blog brings together posts from various Python bloggers all around the
                    internet, though they do still have their own contributors create unique posts. It’s rich in
                    tutorials, tips and tricks that will make coding in Python a breeze.</p><br>

                <h3>Notable post</h3>
                <p>A post provided by one of the site’s own contributors. It’s a comprehensive tutorial on how

                <img src="img/python5.webp" alt="" width="100%">
                <p> And now for something completely different. We thought that there might be instances in which you
                    want to learn more but for one reason or another—whether you’re stuck in traffic or are simply too
                    tired to keep your eyes open—you can’t read a blog post at the moment.</p><br>

                <p>Here’s where TalkPython comes into play. It’s a similar deal to a lot of the other blogs on this
                    list, but this time it’s a podcast! Kick back and listen to some of the biggest experts in the field
                    talk about useful Python-related topics.</p><br>

                    awesome interests: “software engineering, parenting, math (especially visual aspects, such as
                    geometry), politics, geeky recreations, language, and so on.”

                    Needless to say, you’ll find a ton of really creative articles here, some mixed with puzzles.
                    They’ll be great for Python enthusiasts at any level. We cannot recommend them enough.

                    Although more frequent posts would be more than welcome, there’s a huge collection of older posts to
                    study written by Ned—somebody who’s experimented with and written Python longer than most on this
                    list. </p><br>

                <h3>Notable post </h3>
                <p>“Why your mock still doesn’t work” is a great example of Ned’s interesting way of writing, but you
                    should especially check out his “What’s in which Python,” a helpful summary of what features
                    appeared in which versions of Python, all in one place. </p><br>

                <h3>Final thoughts on the top Python blogs</h3>
                <p> Python is an incredible solution that opens up a ton of opportunities, but we know all too well just
                    how much looking up reliable sources of knowledge on the topic can take. We hope our little list
                    will come in handy, giving you all the info you need in an organized, digestible form.
