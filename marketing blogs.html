                <p> Blog Marketing is a content marketing strategy. The marketing strategy uses blogs to address
                    potential customers directly and individually, thus achieving customer loyalty for their own brand.
                    This type of marketing uses viral marketing methods in which an interest group is built based on a
                    blog. Readers can interact with the producers of content that is generally informative and
                    entertaining, therefore increasing brand loyalty and identification potential. Shop bloggers for
                    instance work on behalf of specific companies to promote their products and demonstrate their uses.

                <h2>How Blog Marketing Entered Business and Corporate Arenas</h2>


                <p> Blog Marketing is a World Wide Web evolution of business successes. Blog-style content has proved to
                    engage humans on many psychological levels. This marketing strategy derived its purpose from
                    original web loggers. The term “web log” became “weblog” which became today’s “blog”.</p><br>


                <p>Blog Marketing strategy entered business marketing arenas because of the onset of both technological
                    advances and evolutional trends. These two events stemmed from personal online journals written by
                    people who could program their own websites. Prior to 1999, only website programmers could customize
                    their blogging platforms.</p> <br>

                <p>When blogging entered the business arena, it traveled through a series of trials beginning with pop
                    culture, politics, and news events. The first media and business blogs were popular because they
                    produced more in-depth coverage than mainstream media websites.</p><br>

                <p>In 2017, businesses use Blog Marketing to engage their target market, potential customers, and retain
                    to current customers.</p><br>

                <h3>Blog Marketing Production</h3>


                <p> In 2017, Blog Marketing has shown to increase lead flow by 60% on average and in some cases as much
                    as 700%. Blog Marketing is an integrated part of content marketing and a strategy for acquiring
                    leads and/or prospects. Predictably, these leads will buy a product or service from the company
                    employing this tactic. There are differing opinions on the definition of leads and prospects. But,
                    Blog Marketing is a proven, effective way to develop leads and prospects.
                </p><br>

                <p> Also, as of 2017, Blog Marketing is easily managed and produced on the blog pages of a commercial
                    website. The revolutionary ease of use with website formats like WordPress and Hubspot do not
                    require webmaster services to move, add, delete, and update content on a Website.</p><br>


                <p>Blog Marketing content relies on personas, also called customer profiles and buyer personas. Personas
                    are defined by the use of search habits of website visitors’ keyword searches as well as website
                    behavior. Blog Marketing utilizes several other information-mining systems that record visitors’
                    interactive behavior on a website. This website tracks persona actions and retrieves their data.
                    This data then becomes the purpose for the content of the business blog.</p><br>



                <h3>Elements and Components of Blog Marketing</h3>


                <p> Sprout Content, an industry leader in “the business of conversation”, offers the following reasons

                <p>2. Search engine optimization (SEO): Search engines reward valuable content that is regularly
                    published.</p><br>
                <p>3. Companies do not need the services of a webmaster to implement Blog Marketing because of the
                    development of revolutionary blogging platforms like WordPress and Hubspot.</p><br>
                <p>4. Businesses that blog can accumulate up to 60% more customers</p><br>
                <p>5. A blog is the purpose for all content marketing goals. Businesses can use their blog’s content on
                    Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and for ebooks and email newsletters or anywhere they distribute
                    content.</p><br>
                <p>6. Blogs give a company a voice and connect its audience to new products and services, news, timely
                    information, market trends, and to what happens at the company beyond its website.</p><br>
                <p>7. Blogs showcase a company’s expertise and influencers and establish industry credibility.</p><br>
                <p>8. Blogs establish two-way conversations with customers, industry associates, and potential buyers by
                    creating a comment section below the blog. This can build confidence in the company and can increase
                    sales.</p><br>
                <p>9. One of the elements of Blog Marketing includes creating a blog calendar similar to an editorial
                    calendar. Blogging keeps a company centered on its content marketing goals.</p><br>
                <p>10. Blog Marketing is a public relations tool. News outlets and journalists pay attention to high
                    profile blogs and bloggers.</p><br>
                <p>11. A business must define who its audience is and why it is blogging to that demographic. This
                    tightens up the purpose of the company’s marketing strategies.</p><br>
                <p>12. Companies can promote their brand stories, relay company philosophies, highlight employees, and
                    reveal innovative ideas through blogging. This lets customers and prospects understand how that
                    business can help solve customer problems with its products and services.</p><br>
                <p>13. Blogs are long-term marketing assets and extremely cost-effective. Blogs do not go away. In 2017,
                    many websites maintain a content curation page on their website which drives SEO.</p><br>
                <p>14. Companies can take advantage of blog analytics which keep a log of click-through rates, trending
                    topics, social media shares, comments, and what days and times of the day the blog receives the most
                    visitors.</p><br>
