                    to scour the internet to see what other people are doing and saying. While it’s great to stay
                    up-to-date on trends through magazines and books, web development blogs provide you with an
                    abundance of fresh, free content. Blogs have become increasingly more popular over the years and
                    even though sports and fashion blogs led the charge at first, it’s now very likely that every topic
                    out there has at least one blog dedicated to it. </p><br>

                    this difficulty, we decided to compile some of our favorite blogs and urge you to take a look:
                </p><br>
